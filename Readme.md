# Hello there , Myself - Shivani Y.
you can find me - [twitter](https://twitter.com/nteasocial) or via [nteasocial@gmail.com](mailto:nteasocial@gmail.com)

I have read the html file thoroughly and I m glad that, I have been part of the process of this amazing task.

# # The highlights - 
Everything is divided in section with their view-content
Using the classes from backend and Bootstrap 
CSS utility classes are given in the file and you have to figure and play around the best that fit for your design
Design is really visionary to begin with the project
I understood the importance of keeping everything organised and as per intact as per the css given css file
I also checked the other page-1.html to get more insights, how everything is build
I understood that theres a primary block and secondary block
It is astonishing to get idea how complex things works and hoping to get ahead more with such tasks

# # How I created this prototype into code -
I made few changes in the page.html
Imported the css file to stylesheet-6
I added lesser classes tried to implement and work with the given workflow
I have made mobile responsive first and its a good tip to follow as you start building
I played and read the design file with the importance of every element should be implemented
Check the css file to get more info about which class is for which component

# # My Beliefs- 
Design is the followup you should keep in mind while carrying your own experiments and taking risks
I have done the same while implementing the code

# # # hoping to have the great conversation & discussion ahead.
I can try to make another prototype by getting response from the team, would love to know the insight.
